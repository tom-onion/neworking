# <div style="color: #4493f6;">What is a network? (LAN, WAN, internet)</div>

A **network** is a group of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, phones, and printers) that can communicate and share resources (like files, internet access, or printers). Networks can vary in size and scope, and they are typically classified into different types based on their scale and purpose. The three most common types are:

---

### 1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**

* **Definition**: A LAN is a network that covers a small geographic area, like a home, office, or school.
* **Example**: Your Wi-Fi network at home connecting your laptop, smartphone, and printer.
* **Characteristics**:

  * High speed
  * Private ownership
  * Limited to a single building or campus

---

### 2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

* **Definition**: A WAN spans a large geographic area and connects multiple LANs together.
* **Example**: A corporation's offices in different cities connected via leased communication lines.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Slower than LANs (typically)
  * Public or private ownership
  * Can span cities, countries, or even continents

---

### 3. **Internet**

* **Definition**: The internet is a **global network of networks**‚Äîit connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
* **Example**: When you browse a website or send an email, you're using the internet.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Largest WAN
  * Open and public
  * Uses standard protocols like TCP/IP

# What is an IP address? (IPv4 vs IPv6)

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to find and communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

## üìå **What is an IP Address?**

* Think of it like a **home address** for your device on a network.
* It helps route data to the correct destination (e.g., when you open a website).

---

## üìñ **Types of IP Addresses**

There are two main versions of IP addresses:

---

### **1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**

* **Format**: `192.168.1.1` (four numbers separated by dots)
* **Each number** ranges from 0 to 255
* **Bit length**: 32-bit
* **Total addresses**: About **4.3 billion**
* **Most commonly used** today

‚úÖ **Example**: `172.16.254.1`
‚ùó **Limitation**: Running out of unique addresses due to the growth of the internet

---

### **2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**

* **Format**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` (eight groups of four hexadecimal digits)
* **Bit length**: 128-bit
* **Total addresses**: **340 undecillion** (that‚Äôs 340 trillion trillion trillion!)
* **Designed to replace IPv4**

‚úÖ **Advantages**:

* Much **larger address space**
* **Better security and efficiency**
* **No need for NAT** (Network Address Translation)
