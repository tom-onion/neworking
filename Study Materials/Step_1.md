# What is a network? (LAN, WAN, internet)

A **network** is a group of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, phones, and printers) that can communicate and share resources (like files, internet access, or printers). Networks can vary in size and scope, and they are typically classified into different types based on their scale and purpose. The three most common types are:

---

### 1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**

* **Example**: Your Wi-Fi network at home connecting your laptop, smartphone, and printer.
* **Characteristics**:

  * High speed
  * Private ownership
  * Limited to a single building or campus

---

### 2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

* **Definition**: A WAN spans a large geographic area and connects multiple LANs together.
* **Example**: A corporation's offices in different cities connected via leased communication lines.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Slower than LANs (typically)
