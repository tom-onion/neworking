### 🔹 **Step 3: Master IP Addressing and Subnetting**

#### 📘 Topics to Study:
- **IP Addressing**:
  - **IPv4**: What an IPv4 address looks like (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - **Subnet Masks**: What are subnet masks, and how do they work with IP addresses?
  - **Private vs Public IP addresses**: Understand the difference and where they’re used (e.g., 192.168.x.x is a private address).
  - **CIDR Notation**: Learn how CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) represents a network.

- **Subnetting**:
  - How to divide a network into subnets using subnet masks.
  - Practice calculating the number of subnets and hosts within a subnet.
  - **Subnetting Techniques**: Learn how to split IP networks into smaller, more efficient subnetworks, which is crucial for both network design and security.

- **Classful Addressing (Class A, B, C, etc.)**: Understand how IP addresses are categorized.
- **Private IP ranges**: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255.
- **VLANs**: Understand how Virtual LANs (VLANs) work to segment networks.

#### 🧠 How to Study:
- **Subnetting Practice**: Subnetting is essential and can be tricky at first. Use online subnetting calculators and subnetting practice problems.
  - Websites like [Subnetting Practice](https://www.subnettingpractice.com/) or books like *"Subnetting Made Simple"* can help.
- **YouTube Tutorials**: Watch videos explaining subnetting step by step.
- **Interactive Tools**: Try out interactive labs such as [IP Subnetting Tool](https://www.subnettingquestions.com/) to visually see how subnets work.

#### 🛠️ Practical Tools:
- **IP Calculators**: Use subnet calculators to check your work when learning.
- **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking): Learn how to calculate variable-length subnets to optimize address space usage.

By mastering IP addressing and subnetting, you'll be prepared for more complex networking scenarios and challenges in cybersecurity. It's a core skill that underpins network design and security analysis.
